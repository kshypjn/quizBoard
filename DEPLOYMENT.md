# ðŸš€ Deploying Quiz Scoreboard to Vercel

## Multi-Device Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy from the project directory**:

   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Set up and deploy? **Yes**

   - Link to existing project? **No**
   - What's your project's name? **quiz-scoreboard** (or your preferred name)
   - In which directory is your code located? **./**

### 2. How Multi-Device Works

Once deployed, your quiz scoreboard will be accessible at a URL like:
`https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

#### **Multi-Device Usage:**

1. **Device 1 (Quiz Master/Controller)**:

   - Open the URL on your computer/tablet
   - Set up teams and control scoring
   - All score changes are saved to the server

2. **Device 2+ (Viewers)**:
   - Open the same URL on phones, tablets, or other devices
   - View the live scoreboard
   - Scores update automatically when refreshed

#### **How It Works:**

- **Shared Backend**: All devices connect to the same Vercel-deployed API
- **Real-time Updates**: When you update scores on Device 1, they're saved to the server
- **Live Viewing**: Device 2+ can refresh the page to see updated scores
- **No Setup Required**: Just share the URL with anyone who wants to view scores
